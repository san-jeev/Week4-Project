# Week4-Project
# Chest X-Ray Image Classification (Normal or Pneumonia) using Transfer Learning 
#1- Download Chest X-Ray Data From Kaggle<br>
#2- Plot Normal and Pneumonia Chest X-Ray Images<br>
#3- Chest Xray Image Preprocessing/ Augmentation/ Transformation for Model Training, Validation and Testing Dataset<br>
#4- Create InceptionV3 Base CNN Model<br>
#5- Create a Sequential Model for traing & prediction. Add base model, pooling layer & fully connected Dense layers<br>
#6- Compile the Sequential Model and Display Model Summary<br>
#7- Fit and Train the Sequential Model and Display Results<br>
#8- Evaluate the Sequential Model Performance and Show Results<br>
#9- Test the pre-trained Sequential Model and Show Results<br>
